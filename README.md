[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brettbode/wxmacmolplt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brettbode/wxmacmolplt) Build on trusty against wxWidgets 2.8

wxMacMolPlt is a wxWidgets rewrite of MacMolPlt by Brett Bode's research group at
Iowa State University. The source code to this program is released under the 
terms of the license file in this directory.

Currently wxMacMolPlt includes build files and has been tested on Mac OS X,
Linux and Windows. Since most people building from source will be running
Linux this file focuses on the build instructions for Linux. To build from
source on any OS you must have a C++ compiler such as g++ and an install
of wxWidgets with OpenGL support enabled. wxWidgets 2.6 and later have been
used in the past, but current testing is on 2.8 and later.
Prebuilt packages of wx should also work and are generally preferrable.
Newer versions such as 2.8.x and 3.x have been tested on many recent 
Linux distros and are preferred.

For further build instructions refer the INSTALL file in this directory.

An html manual is included that includes a quick walkthrough of the program's
capabilities.
