<H2>Downloading wxMacMolPlt</H2>
<p>
wxMacMolPlt is available as a source code tar file and as pre-built binaries for Mac OS X, Windows and several varieties of Linux. If a pre-built binary is available for your platform please try it first to avoid any issues with the build process.
<p>
Most of my development work is done on Mac OS X. Thus, that tends to be the best tested. If you do not see a binary for your OS here please submit a request with information on your OS and hardware architecture.

<H3>Debian/Ubuntu Linux</H3>
<b>Please note that the shutdown of the long time home of MacMolPlt means that the Debian repo is now on a new site!</b> Currently the packages are only available from our own repository. I believe that the following choices will work on the latest releases of Ubuntu and Debian. If you have an issue or need a build for an older release just make a request via the <a href="https://github.com/brettbode/wxmacmolplt/issues">issues tab</a>. To obtain them add the following line (pick the one appropriate for your OS version) to your /etc/apt/sources.list:
<P>
Debain Jesse and later (built against wxWidgets 3.0.2 package):
<UL>
<LI>deb https://dl.bintray.com/brettbode/Jesse/ Jesse main
</UL>
Debian Wheezy and later:
<UL>
<LI>deb https://dl.bintray.com/brettbode/wxMacMolPlt-wheezy wheezy main
</UL>
For Ubuntu 14.04 and later:
<UL>
<LI>deb https://dl.bintray.com/brettbode/Trusty trusty main
</UL>
For Ubuntu 12.04 and later:
<UL>
<LI>deb https://dl.bintray.com/brettbode/wxMacMolPlt-precise precise main
</UL>
Then apt-get update. You should then be able to install using apt-get install wxmacmolplt for amd64 and i386 for the older architectures. 
I do not currently have a good way to host a debian source repo. If you would
like to build your own debian bianry package grab the source tarball, unpack it. Change into the base wxmacmolplt directory and issue "debuild". You will have to have the dev-scripts package and other dependancies installed, but that will build a binary .deb package for the current architecture.

Similarly you can use the wxMacMolPlt.rpm.spec file in the resources directory as input to rpmbuild to build a binary rpm package.
<p>
<!--For other architectures you can build a binary package and install with
<UL>
<LI>apt-get build-dep wxmacmolplt
<LI>apt-get -b source wxmacmolplt
<LI>dpkg -i wxmacmolpltx.x.x.deb
</UL>
Note this will download and build in the current directory. Once you have installed the .deb file you can remove everything from the current directory. If you are running an older Debian or Ubuntu system you will need to follow the building from source directions below.
-->
<p>Note: Many newer Debian/Ubuntu distros are requiring signed packages by
default. Since I do not have a recognized key these are unsigned so you may need
to add "--allow-unauthenticated" to your apt-get command.</P>
<H2>Source Code</H2>
If none of those work for you download the source code and follow the instructions below or in the INSTALL file contained in the source tar file. The prerequisites for building MacMolPlt from source are a working C++ compiler (g++ preferred) and a wxWidgets (version 2.6.3 or newer, but 2.8 or newer recommended) install including the development pieces. You can test for a working wxWidgets install using wx-config --version. If the response is 2.6.3 or greater you should be fine and you can go directly to building MacMolPlt below. If you have hardware supporting stereo display (quad-buffered OpenGL) you may wish to grab the latest wxWidgets 3.x release to enable stereo support in MacMolPlt. If your Linux distribution does not offer a prebuilt wxWidgets package, usually named something like wxGTK or libwxgtk version 2.6.3 or newer then you will have to first build and install wxWidgets. Follow these steps to build wxWidgets:
<p>
Download the latest wxWidgets source (2.6.3 through 3.0.2 have worked in the past). Unpack the archive and cd into the top level directory.
<P>
Configure wx to use OpenGL and unicode:<br>
./configure --with-gtk --with-opengl --enable-unicode<BR>
make<BR>
make install<BR>
<p>
Note: You can install wx into a non-system directory, but that directory will need to be added to your shared library path or shared libraries disabled in the build (--disable-shared). If you get an error in the MacMolPlt configure step saying your wxWidgets build lacks OpenGL support first make sure that the directory where the shared libraries is installed is in /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig. You should only need to do that once.
<p>
Building MacMolPlt. This should be very straightforward.
<p>
./configure
<p>
If your wxWidgets install is not on your path add --with-wx-config=/path/to/wx-config<br>
To install somewhere other than /usr/local add --prefix=/path/to/top/dir
<p>
make<br>

make install
<p>
Note: The "make install" step is required as there are a couple of resource files that the application needs at run time to be fully functional.
