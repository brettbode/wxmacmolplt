   <LI>It reads a variety of file formats including any GAMESS input, log or
   IRC file directly to create animations of IRC's,
   DRC's, and optimizations. You may also import a $VEC group from
   any file (such as a GAMESS .DAT file). In addition xMol XYZ files, MolDen
   format files and
   Chemical Markup Language (CML) files are supported. Also some PDB file 
   support and MDL MolFile support is included.<BR>

<H3>Ancient History</H3>
<P>Where does the wxMacMolPlt name originate?
<UL>
<LI>The name is a rather un-original combination of the past evolution of the 
program. The inspiration was the simple X-Windows MolPlt program (though no 
code was reused) that was re-invented as the MacMolPlt program in 1994 (so 
named due to it's Mac-only implementation). MacMolPlt evolved over many years 
from a very simple interactive 2D program on very underpowered Macs to a full 
3D program with many computational capabilities. In 2006 the MacMolPlt code 
was ported to the wxWidgets toolkit enabling cross-platform builds on Macs, 
Windows and Linux and wx was added to the name. Since then a graphical 
molecule builder has also been added along with many other improvements.
