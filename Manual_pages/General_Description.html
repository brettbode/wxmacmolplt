<P>MacMolPlt is designed to make it easy to visualize output whenever
you need it, without needing to specify special output options to
GAMESS or having to manually edit files to create an input file. But
it is also designed to produce output of good quality such that it
can be used in publications. Generally MacMolPlt will read in all the
information it needs from a GAMESS log file, but several other
<A HREF="MacMolPlt_Files.html">file types</A> are supported and you
can also paste in coordinates in a variety of cartesian formats
including the formats used in GAMESS output files and Gaussian log
files.</P>

<P>Once you have data in the program you can translate and rotate the
molecule using the mouse or manually by entering the molecule center
and rotation angles. You can also view
<A HREF="MacMolPlt_Surfaces.html">orbitals, total electron densities
and Molecular Electrostatic Potentials</A> as 2D or 3D surfaces.
Depending on the data read in you can animation normal modes, or
geometry optimizations, IRC's and DRP's (any file with multiple
geometeries).</P>

<P>MacMolPlt includes a standard interface for opening
files, saving files, printing, copying, window movement, and display
commands. One very nice feature is tooltip help support. Particularly
in the input builder window tooltips are used to further explain each
option and indicate the GAMESS input option. Rotation in the display window is
controlled by the mouse in a fairly intuitive fashion using a virtual 3D trackball.
The scroll wheel or Shift+left button zoom the display and the right button or 
Control+left button translate the molecule.  The size of the molecule display and
various normal mode display options are controlled via the Display
menu. Atomic coordinates and bonds can be viewed in separate windows
and bonds may be added via a bond radius and/or an automatic bonding
feature that can determine multiple bonds and hydrogen bonding.</P>

<P>An interactive <a href="builder.html">graphical molecule editor</a> is included. There is also an input file generator for GAMESS. It can make it easy to create many GAMESS input files including MO guess and internal coordinates. It doesn't have all advanced options yet, but works quite well for the basics including the use of MO vectors from one run as input to a follow on run.</P>
